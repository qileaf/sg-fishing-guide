# :fish: SG Fishing Guide :fish:
##### An analysis of environmental factors affecting fish feeding behaviour to forecast future fishing conditions for a tiered pricing system of their fishing guide services

### Problem Statement
A fishing guide company called SG Fishing Guide operating in the Eastern waters of Singapore is exploring the feasibility of a tiered pricing system for their fishing guide services. Instead of having a fixed price for hiring a guide each day throughout the year, the company would like to have a tiered pricing system where customers will be charged:

 - lower prices for days when the fishing conditions are less than ideal, and 
 - higher prices for days with optimal fishing conditions. 

### Scope

This project aims to analyze the trends and patterns of environmental conditions which affect the quality of fishing and forecast the fishing conditions of future dates for the planning of their tiered pricing system.
